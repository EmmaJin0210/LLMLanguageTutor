#### Speech
* Whisper doesn't seem to work all that well? Need to experiement more on if it autocorrects too much

#### Difficulty
* Adding to the system prompt "Try to limit yourself to words and grammar in the N5 and N4 level"
seems to make no significant difference in output.
* Prompting model to limit itself to a certain list of words works a little bit but not that well.
* Prompting model to limit verbs to a list of verbs seem to work slightly better
-> will experiment with nouns, adj, and adv as well.
