# utils to compile files specified into a master list
# will look something like: <word> : {<level 1> : <meaning 1>,
                                    # <level 2> : <meaning 2>}
# from low difficulty to high difficulty (we'll always match it with the lowest difficulty? or by POS?)
# use case: for words that look the same but have different meanings in different levels
